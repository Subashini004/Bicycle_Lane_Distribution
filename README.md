# 🚴‍♂️ Bicycle Lane Distribution and Accident Analysis 📊

This project explores the distribution of bicycle lanes using **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** data and analyzes road accident patterns to inform better planning of safe cycling infrastructure.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Visualize bicycle lane networks across urban areas using `OSMnx` and `Folium`.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on road traffic accident data.
- Correlate accident-prone zones with lack of bicycle-friendly infrastructure.
- Provide insights and potential recommendations for safe route planning.
